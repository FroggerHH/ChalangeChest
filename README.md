when you open the big map on the left side, there is a timer after how many events
When it appears on the map, a timer label appears

you come there, pumped mobs are waiting
there, you kill every mob , a chest with loot is spawned
PVP is forcibly turned on in the event area (btw configurable)
different biomes - different mobs
the event may have different difficulty
for each, you can customize mobs
and loot in config

generated config file is 1290 lines long, so I won't show it here, but you can find it on github
